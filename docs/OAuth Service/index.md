# What is OAuth?

OAuth 2.0 is a spec that is designed to help developers get resource access without needing to share login tokens. For example, you can request permissions and the user may accept or deny these requests.

In Sponsus, OAuth is used to verify a user is who they say they are. In these docs, we will describe to you how to setup and use our OAuth service.
